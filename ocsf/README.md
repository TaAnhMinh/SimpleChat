# Installing and Running OCSF

To install OCSF, compile all the .java files in the client and
server directories.

OCSF is a Framework, so this directory contains no main program. To
learn how it works, consult the book
[Object-Oriented Software Engineering: Practical Software Development using UML and Java](http://www.lloseng.com)
by Lethbridge and Lagani&egrave;re.

To use OCSF, import the `ocsf.client` or `ocsf.server` package in your
application code. Make sure that the ocsf directory is in your classpath
when you compile your application.
